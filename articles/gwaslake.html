<p>We are indebted to the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for producing the infrastructure leading to the following schematic:</p>

<p>The packages identified in the ecosystem are mostly accessed through github repositories. The interdependencies and idiosyncrasies of using Remotes in DESCRIPTION made it difficult to produce a container image, so I have forked several of the packages identified in the schematic, to tweak the DESCRIPTIONs. I have filed some pull requests but have not heard back. I will try to keep the DESCRIPTION for this workshop package current, minimizing use of forks, and hope individual package maintainers will get in touch.</p>

<p>First, by using the searchable table above, we can obtain the study id for “Asthma”: <code>ieu-a-44</code>. We can then obtain the top “hits” for this trait (a p-value threshold can be specified; default is 5e-8).</p>

<p>It will be possible to map even more traits once more careful textual analysis is performed on the <code>traits</code> vector. For example, one study uses <code>Diagnoses - main ICD10: K50 Crohn's disease [regional enteritis]</code> to name its trait. The code given above will not find this.</p>

<p>The <code>associations</code> function of <code>ieugwasr</code> produces a filtered set of hits for a given region in a given study. The <code>manhattanPlot</code> function of gwaslake simplifies this to some extent, and provides a visualization. One can specify a gene symbol and a flanking radius in base pairs, but one still needs to know the ieugwasr <code>id</code> of the study of interest.</p>
