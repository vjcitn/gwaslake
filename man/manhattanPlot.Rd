\title{produce a manhattan plot for a given study, based on specific coordinates or gene symbol with radius for flanking region}
\usage{
manhattanPlot(
  studyID = "ubm-a-524",
  symbol = "BCAN",
  start = NULL,
  stop = NULL,
  chromosome = NULL,
  radius = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{studyID}{character(1) id of study in ieugwasr::gwasinfo() catalog, defaults to "ubm-a-524", which is
a study described in Elliott et al Nature October 2018}

\item{symbol}{a gene symbol (to be used with \code{genesym_to_string}, implicitly); if absent, chromosome, start and end must be supplied, defaults to 'BCAN'}

\item{start}{chromosomal address to start region (will have radius subtracted if supplied)}

\item{stop}{chromosomal address to end region (will have radius added if supplied)}

\item{chromosome}{name of chromosome in Ensembl nomenclature (e.g., 1, 2, ...)}

\item{radius}{numeric default to zero, specifies flanking region}
}
