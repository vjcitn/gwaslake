# Introduction

We are indebted to the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for
producing the infrastructure leading to the following schematic:

![mrc eco](mrcieuglue.png)

## Caveat about software component maintenance

The packages identified in the ecosystem are mostly
accessed through github repositories.  The interdependencies
and idiosyncrasies of using Remotes in DESCRIPTION made it
difficult to produce a container image, so I have forked several
of the packages identified in the schematic, to tweak the
DESCRIPTIONs.  I have filed some pull requests but have not
heard back.  I will try to keep the DESCRIPTION for this workshop
package current, minimizing use of forks, and hope individual
package maintainers will get in touch.

## Basic goals

- To understand the resources underlying the IEU GWAS API.
- To explore genetic analyses supported by the gwasglue
infrastructure.

# The API viewed through ieugwasr

We'll start by listing the functions available in the `ieugwasr` package.

```{r chk1}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
library(gwaslake)
library(ieugwasr)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
})
ls("package:ieugwasr")
```

The pkgdown site for `ieugwasr` includes a reference listing, visible [here](https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/reference/index.html).

Let's try the gwasinfo command.  

```{r lkgwinf}
gwi = gwasinfo()
gwi
```

That's a huge table.  We can get an overview by tabulating the 'batches' into which
studies have been organized.

```{r lkbat}
gb = batches()
datatable(gb)
```


## Diseases available

```{r lkdis}
 table(gwi$category)
distab = gwi %>% filter(category=="Disease")
distab %>% 
   group_by(trait) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

A searchable table will be useful.
```{r lkdt}
datatable(as.data.frame(distab))
```

## GWAS hits and their annotation

The [pkgdown document](https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/articles/guide.html) 
on `ieugwasr` is highly informative.  We work through some examples here
to verify functionality of our container.

First, by using the searchable table above, we can obtain the study
id for "Asthma": `ieu-a-44`.  We can then obtain the top "hits" for
this trait (a p-value threshold can be specified; default is 5e-8).
```{r lktop}
asthtop = tophits("ieu-a-44")
asthtop
```
Basic annotation on these hits can be obtained using
either positions or rsids.
```{r anno1}
asthv = variants_rsid(asthtop$rsid)
datatable(asthv)
```

## PheWAS/eQTL lookup

Let's follow up our hit in GSDMB with a 'PheWAS'.
The p-value threshold is indicated in documentation to be 0.00001.

```{r doph}
gdp = phewas("rs2290400")
datatable(gdp)
```

A number of the traits are genes, and the findings come from
eQTL studies.  Let's see where these genes are located.

```{r lkuppheq}
eqtab = gdp[grep("^eqtl", gdp$id),]
eqtab = bind_sym(eqtab)
table(eqtab$gchrom)
```

So there are 'trans' hits for our GSDMB-resident asthma SNP.
